; RP2040 PIO program for QSPI communication with FPGA
; Run "pioasm rp2040_fpga_qspi.pio rp2040_fpga_qspi.pio.h" to regenerate the C header from this.

; QSPI read/write program
; Input shift register: shift right, autopush, threshold 8, 16 or 32 bits
; Output shift register: shift right, autopull, threshold 8, 16 or 32 bits
; OUT mapping: 4 QSPI data pins
; IN mapping: 4 QSPI data pins
; SIDESET mapping: SCK pin
;
; The transfer size per FIFO entry is set by autopush & autopull thresholds.
; Using 16- or 32-bit sizes improves performance but requires divisible total count.
;
; When writing, the RX FIFO contents can be discarded.
; When reading, the TX FIFO is written with dummy bytes to set number of items.
;
; Pin directions should be set before starting the program.

    out PINS, 4     side 0    ; Write low nibble (if TX)
    in PINS, 4      side 1    ; Clock rising edge, read low nibble (if RX)
    out PINS, 4     side 1    ; Write high nibble (if TX)
    in PINS, 4      side 0    ; Clock falling edge, read high nibble (if RX)
